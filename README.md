# Minesweeper
My Nicolas Cage Minesweeper Game.

Hi! At my second year of college I've made this minesweeper game in java, but as I wanted something funnier than recommended by the teacher, I decided to do it with the nicholas cage theme.

If you download this game and look at the code, you're probaly face a lot of bugs and maybe think: "why did she take the long path here?" or "what a daunting function, it would be easier if...". And that's because at that time I was a little padawan at the programming world. You might be asking yourself right now why didn't I refactor the code.  And my ideia is to use this little project to remember me (and maybe you) that everyone has to start somewhere. So, if you want to, you can use this code as a way of learning the "dont's" of java or OOP. Enjoy it!
